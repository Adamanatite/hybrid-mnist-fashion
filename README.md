# Hybrid CNN / Autoencoder Network for Classifying MNIST Fashion Dataset
An implementation of a hybrid CNN/Autoencoder network for classifying the MNIST fashion dataset, completed for a 4th year university course.
The Jupyter notebook contains:
* An implementation of a CNN network for classifying the MNIST fashion dataset
* An implementation of an autoencoder network for producing lower dimensional representations of the dataset images.
* A combination of the previous two networks into a hybrid network for classifying the MNIST fashion dataset
* An application of the combined network for removing binary thresholding on MNIST fashion images (restoring images made up of pixels which are either black or white) and classifying.
* Hyperparameter tuning and network architecture at each of the previous stages to maximise performance
* Various data visualisations of network performance and the effect of different hyperparameters and network architectures
* Written explanations of methodology and results after each stage
